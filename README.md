Heretic is something between a framework and a boilerplate which allows you to build a blazing fast and modern static website which combines both SSR and SPA approaches. 

It's based on [Marko](https://markojs.com/), a language for building dynamic and reactive user interfaces - it's as if HTML and JS had a perfect baby that grew up to be awesome. Also under the hood: [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), internationalization out-of-the-box and much more.

The goal is to focus on optimization and speed. You decide what will be included in the bundles, and the SPA approach provides maximum speed. At the same time, an important aspect is the support of SEO.
