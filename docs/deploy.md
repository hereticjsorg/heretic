# Deploy

There are no extra actions from your side necessary to run Heretic in development mode (just start Heretic by running *npm run server* command). However, in order to improve website performance in production mode you will need some additional steps.

## Running in Daemon Mode

You will need to run Heretic web server in a daemon mode when running in production. There are many options how to achieve this depending on your operating system (systemd, init.d etc.). However, a recommended way is to use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online.

There is a PM2 configuration file (*ecosystem.config.js*) which allows to run you Heretic website by running a simple command:

```
pm2 start
```

Please refer to the [PM2 docs](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) to learn some tips and tricks on how to implement additional PM2 features.

## Proxy Web Server Configuration

Heretic needs to run as web server in order to render modules on server-side. In development mode, Heretic may also serve static assets for you (which is not recommended in production mode), please check [configuration files](configurationFiles.md) to disable or enable the *static* parameter in *./etc/system.js*.

It's recommended to use a proxy server such as NGINX in production. The simple configuration for NGINX may look like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/example.com/dist/public;
    access_log /var/www/example.com/logs/nginx_access.log;
    error_log /var/www/example.com/logs/nginx_error.log;
    location / {
        try_files $uri @heretic;
    }
    location @heretic {
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;
    }
    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
    gzip on;
    gzip_min_length 10240;
    gzip_comp_level 1;
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_disable msie6;
    gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth;
    gzip_types text/css
        text/javascript
        text/xml
        text/plain
        text/x-component
        application/javascript
        application/x-javascript
        application/json
        application/xml
        application/rss+xml
        application/atom+xml
        font/truetype
        font/opentype
        application/vnd.ms-fontobject
        image/svg+xml;
}        
```

## Standalone

The *dist* and *node_modules* directories may work in standalone mode. This means that it's the only directories which might be copied to the production server (no and other directories are required in order to run).

However, it's recommended to keep the file structure as-is, because that's how you may simplify your updates and website rebuilds.
