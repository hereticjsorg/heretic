# Logs Module

Logs module allows the admin to see the list of all activity made my any user; the main difference between Logs module and Events module is that Events track only the user-related events, while the Logs track every interaction with the server.

By clicking the "Data" button you may be able to export the list contents to Excel or tab-separated values file.

To perform this:

1. Select the items to export by clicking on the checkbox in front of each entry you pick, or apply the filter to the list and pick all
2. Click "Data" &rarr; "Export to file". In the appeared window you'll see the amount of items for export, export type (Excel or Tab-Separated Values) and each entry's contents you can adjust to export
3. Press "Export" button to initiate the process
