## etc/meta.json

This configuration file describes the meta data of your website which is used system-wide.

| Option      | Description                                                                     |

## src/config/languages.json

This configuration file contains a list of languages in the following format:

```json
{
    "en-us": "English",
    "ru-ru": "Русский"
}
```

## src/config/navigation.json

This file is being used as a source to display the top navigation menu on your website (in the default template). Additionally, you've to set the default route ID.

For each area, "userspace" and "admin", you may define a separate list of routes.

*Userspace*:

| Option | Description                                              |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| home   | Home route ID                                            |
| routes | Array which contains all routes to display in the navbar |

*Admin*:

| Option | Description                                              |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| routes | Array which contains all routes to display in the navbar |

Normally, *routes* options contains an array of strings (each strings indicates a corresponding route ID). If you want to use dropdown menus for routes, you can use the following syntax:

```json
{
	"home": "home",
	"routes": [
		"home",
		"license",
		{
			"id": "parentRouteName",
			"routes": ["childRouteId1", "childRouteId2", "childRouteId3"]
		}
	]
}
```

You will need to add a translation for *parentRouteName* to your user translation dictionaries. Add your route IDs to *routes* array.

## Auto-Generated Files

Some files are auto-generated during the build process. Most of them are located in the *./src/build* directory. There is no need to edit anything there because each file gets overwritten on every build.
